            <div id="textvision" class="normaltext">
                <p> We check an app to see if we have slept well, we have more friends in our online community than around us, and we look
                more often at nature digitally than that we spend in it. — We live in a world where technology and digitalization is
                starting to overtake our human essence. Our society takes a monetizing and maximalising attitude, overvaluing the
                technological while dismissing the subtle depth and quality of being human.</p>
                <p>I see a future in which our worries of loosing jobs to AI are valid, as we have set up a structure in which human
                qualities are not valued anymore; we are chasing technology’s qualities of being efficient, fast, precise and accurate.
                But, we still have the opportunity to steer away from this future. It is not too late to think about and work towards
                alternative futures.</p>
                <p>This is where I believe my purpose as designer comes in. I believe as designer I am able to design solutions that follow
                alternative societal perspectives, but am also capable of inspiring others to do so too. By using design as a
                transformational tool, I create moments of friction that encourage people to step out of “the way things are”,
                highlighting the structures of today. Only by stepping out and seeing things from a new perspective, can we as humans
                think freely and see alternative ways, allowing us to picture and work towards a different, better future.</p>
                <p>In this pursuit, I am guided by the philosophy of Pragmatism by William James [11]. Through a pragmatic attitude, I have
                learnt to see the world from a pluralist, dynamic and interconnected perspective. We are not discovering a fixed
                reality, but co-create it every day, just like our beliefs and the world moulded by it.</p>
                <p>In my design work, this results in 3 core principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We should understand the volatility of life and embrace constant change; leave room for complexity and ambiguity, and
                    keep questioning the things that we already think we understand.</li>
                    <li>Stay pragmatic, stay in the here and now. See actions and habits as mechanisms of the metaphysical, and act using the
                    same language: produce practical tools that play with our bodily experiences. There should be equal emphasis on the
                    tangible realities as how we experience them. Personal and emotional experience is valuable.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to break rules and do things differently, stepping away from principles.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>My goal as a designer is to create friction, spark awareness and, ultimately, inspire a recalibration of our
                relationship with technology. Because for me, design is more than “making”—it is “making things possible.” [3]</p>

            <h1 id="titleidentity" class="title">Professional Identity</h1>
            <div id="textidentity" class="normaltext">
                <p>I grew up in a household of Yin and Yang. Where my mom would relief my stomach aches by ‘pulling it out’ with her hands
                and taught me that thinking and believing can manifest real changes, my dad would help me pick apart objects to figure
                out their internal workings and taught me that everything in life can be explained and all answers lives in matter.
</p>
                <p>Embodying both forms of being in myself, I have become both the engineer and the philosopher. Where in the past I mostly
                felt them as a duality, feeling like I have to choose between the two, I am now learning that they can co-exist. I have
                learned that both of these roles have their own strengths, and deserve their own placement in the design process.
                Embracing the qualities of both.
</p>
                <p> In my work, the philosopher side of me really thrives in the start of the project; it thrives on exploring friction,
                guiding the inquiry through (collective) experiences, and focusing on deeper meaning. The skills I have that belong here
                are post phenomenological analysis, user involvement, analysing quality of interaction, and integrating creative
                processes.
</p>
                <p>The engineer in me gets room once the initial questions are set, bringing it back to the here and now. The fact that I
                can build high quality prototypes, design for data collection and perform analysis, allow me to implement a pragmatic
                approach that uses material and real interactions to study the chosen phenomena [11].
                The philosopher is the drive behind the project process; steering on user involvement and experimentation. The engineer
                provides the tools, the enthusiasm for making and the deep dive.
</p>
                <p>The challenge lies in the balancing of these roles; going too philosophical can lead to projects that never ‘land’, or
                never give something concrete to work with; staying too much in engineering role can make the project ‘flat’ by becoming
                too solution focused, losing the vision behind it all.
</p>
<p>So, as a designer, I aspire to let these two roles collaborate. Because only together can they reach true value; going
from algorithm to intuition, from probabilities to possibilities, and logic to wisdom.</p>

                    the masters Industrial Design at the TU/e, and describe the intentionalities of my personal

                <h1 id="titlepast" class="title">Past</h1>
                <div id="textpast" class="normaltext">
                    <p>Before my masters, I completed the bachelors of Industrial Design at the TU/e. During my bachelors, I did an internship
                    at design agency MMID in Delft [8]. While wanting to learn more about the ‘finalizing stages’ of product design,
                    something that I missed in my education at the time, I quickly realized that the front-end skills that I already
                    developed were actually the ones that made me stand out at the company.</p>
                    <p>While continuing at MMID, first part-time during my FBP and full-time after graduating, I learned that my value lay in
                    the skills I developed at Eindhoven, specifically critical thinking, unravelling conceptual and contextual complexity,
                    and approaching design from a visionary and transformative mindset.
                    This is what made me want to pursue the masters; I felt like the TU/e offered the environment, knowledge and methodology
                    to dive deeper into these skills. Next to this, my experience of working in the industry reinforced my appreciation for
                    the opportunities the academic world provides. It allowed me to still focus on my personal development, work on projects
                    without financial or market interests, and left room for both deep and broad experimentation and explorations.
</p><p>This mentality is also seen back in my development focus within my masters. Throughout my courses and projects, I worked
a lot within speculative design and design friction approaches [2], believing that in that way Creativity & Aesthetics
can help me bring philosophical and sensitive qualities forwards in my work. Wanting to become a visionary designer about new technologies, I wanted to develop my Math, Data and Computing skills of
working with data and code as well, learning to apply both knowledge and tools of this sector.

</p>
<p>So, in my masters I set out to investigate to develop both expertise areas individually, and where and how an
integration between these two aspects can exist; critical and visionary design, and working with data and computing
techniques. I wanted to learn how futuring and speculation can work together with tools like LLMs and ML, and how
intelligence can show attributes of aesthetics [12], to be able to apply this in my own work.
</p>
<p>Next to this, a second development track arose during my master’s; how does this type of work receive a space in the
industry? To get a feel for this, I wanted to use my M2.1 option to find a company for a project collaboration, hoping
to get a feel for the application and value of my skills in a real-industry setting.

                        behavior of people in their living space with a focus on mental health. Through first researching the context of
                        behavior in a specific setting with sensor probes and data collection, we then, in the informed step, intervene the
                        setting with an adjustable light design.</p>

                                    <p class="normaltext">In creative coding, the emphasis lies on using code as a creative cool; controlling randomness, finding unexpected
                                    outcomes, and the beauty of mistakes. In this, I work with data and mathematical rules and conditions, to provide the
                                    boundaries of the code that visualizes the data. However through integrating randomness within a couple of parameters or
                                    ranges, the coding tool becomes an involved agent in the creation process. For now, this work has been limited within

                    application of
                    the expertise areas within, and my professional skills. For this I mostly refer to my Final Master
                    Project.</p>

                <h1 id="titlepresent" class="title">Present</h1>
                <div id="textpresent" class="normaltext">
                    <p>Over the years of being a designer, I have learned ‘how I work’. This means I know what I need to proceed within the
                    process and where my strengths and weaknesses lie.</p>

                    <p>I’ve learnt that I need cooperation in my projects; my creativity flows best if I can speak out loud, spar with others
                    and continue with new ideas, inspiration and input. In order to achieve this, I organize and plan for co-creations,
                    collaborations in projects, meetings with experts, and surround myself in collaborative environments. A clear example of
                    this is my collaboration with C°F. I specifically looked for expertise within designing with data; enhancing my MDC
                    skills that allow me to collect, analyse, and visualize with digital data. I continued with this collaboration in my FMP
                    because of the fit I feel with the studio and to keep collaboration flowing through co-creation and reflection sessions
                    with colleagues, and presenting my work in design meetups.</p>

                    <p>When collaborating with others, clear communication is key. Giving clear project status update presentations to my
                    colleagues allowed me to receive concrete and detailed feedback.
                    Over the semesters, I have gotten better and better at this, even receiving an honorable mention in a pitch competition
                    during the prototype-day at C°F, stating that “the only intern at C°F gave the best presentation”.</p>

                </div>

                <h1 id="titleintegration" class="subtitle">Integration of Areas of Expertise</h1>
                <div id="textintegration" class="normaltext">
                    <p>First of all, my work fully lives within the integration of MDC and CA. During my masters, my work was focused on
                    questioning the role of technology in our everyday life, and how we can work towards a future in which spiritual
                    aesthetics can be found in technology. Think about feeling data visualizations (M2.1) or speculative design on digital
                    twins (Shapeshift). Next to this, I make use of AI tools in the creative process, to inspire, collaborate, or bring in
                    new perspectives, working with the Aesthetics of Intelligence [12].</p>
                    
                    <p>Secondly, inspired by the work of Lee, I use “technology as our moral mirror” [7]. In my work I show notions of post
                    phenomenology and pragmatism in design. Both these integrations require expertise in both TR and US; building prototypes
                    and understanding technological functioning (TR) and seeing societal positioning, understanding social structures and
                    user behavior (US). The attitude of pragmatism in design does something very similar: using making skills to
                    philosophize, working towards an understanding for human and societal complexities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, throughout my design process, I integrate all the areas of expertise, each of them having their own purpose in
                    the process. In the image below, an overview of my design process within my FMP is shown, annotated with how the role
                    the expertise areas played throughout.</p>

                    <p></p>After obtaining my Masters degree of Industrial Design, I have plans for both my professional and personal journey.
                    
                    <p>Professionally, I see myself working within a small design studio, becoming a true team member and content-designer.
                    While I do have an eye for what is needed within a design process, how the next steps can be executed, and for making
                    informed decisions, I do not see myself as a project manager (yet). This is because I have a big love for diving deep,
                    staying close to the content and being able to make and create with my hands (or digital tools).
                    While within my field of interest a PhD would be a more logical career choice, due to its academic freedom and lack of
                    commercial drive, I think a (small) design studio is a better fit for me. Compared to a PhD, it offers more variety of
                    work, more collaboration, and more room for the ‘messy’ side of design.</p>
                    
                    <p>I notice that the most important thing to me is that there is still space for my critical- philosophical attitude, and
                    room for questioning and (playful) research. And if not always present in the work itself (which is very unlikely since
                    this is a very luxurious position to be in), then in the process during the projects. I am therefore going to look for a
                    company that works on storytelling, visionary installations and exhibitions, but most importantly has a company culture
                    that encourages growth, exploration and playfulness.</p>
                    
                    <p>Having learned how important traveling and following ambitions also are for my personal (& professional!) development, I
                    want to travel before fully committing to a professional career.
                    I want to explore southern and eastern Europe by bike: connecting with nature and my surroundings, using only my own
                    strength and a very small collection of possessions to get around. For me the challenge here lies mostly in learning to
                    live small, and needing to connect with the environment and locals to find my way, meet new people, and have a place to
                    stay.</p>
